# Jupyter Code for Service Order Data Extraction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook code that extracts specific information from service order documents in DOCX format. The code utilizes regular expressions (regex) to identify patterns and extract relevant data such as client name, phone number, email address, address, and the problem fixed. The extracted data is then organized into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file that the client can use to create a mailing list for their business.

## Background

This project was my first paid job, and I'm proud to say that the client was very satisfied with the results. The client provided a collection of service order documents in DOCX format and requested assistance in extracting specific information to create a mailing list. With this code, I was able to automate the data extraction process and deliver a convenient solution to the client.

## Features

   - Extracts client information from service order documents in DOCX format.
   - Utilizes regular expressions (regex) to identify patterns and extract relevant data.
   - Organizes extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Saves the extracted data as a CSV file.
   - Enables the client to create a mailing list using the generated CSV file.
   - Includes a standalone .exe file for ease of use.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

   - Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) - For running the code interactively.
   - Python 3.x - The code is written in Python.
   - Pandas - A Python library for data manipulation and analysis. You can install it using the command: pip install pandas.
   - python-docx - A Python library for working with DOCX files. You can install it using the command: pip install python-docx.
   - Tkinter - A Python library for creating GUI applications. 
## Usage

  1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
  2.  Install the required dependencies mentioned in the "Requirements" section.
  3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
  4.  Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file (doc to csv.ipynb).
  5.  Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code.
  6.  Once the code execution is complete, a CSV file named mail_list.csv will be generated.
  7.  Provide the generated CSV file to the client for their use in creating a mailing list.
  8.  Optionally, you can provide the client with the standalone .exe file (doc to csv.exe) for a simplified extraction process.

## Feedback and Testimonials

I am proud to share that the client for whom this code was developed expressed great satisfaction with the results. They found the extraction process to be efficient and accurate, and the generated CSV file provided valuable data for their business. I am always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. I hope this code proves helpful to you as well!

Best regards,
